		"prompt": "Generate the frontend for a React single-page application (SPA) using vanilla CSS (no frameworks like Tailwind).\n\nThe project structure is already set up in a monorepo with React (frontend) and Node.js (backend).\nUser authentication is handled entirely on the backend using Stytch, so the frontend will only consume authentication state (e.g. from a cookie or context provided by the backend).\n\nThe SPA should include the following routes using React Router:\n1. /login: A simple login page with a button to trigger authentication (e.g., redirects or opens magic link flow handled by backend). If already authenticated, redirect to /.\n2. /: The Home page where a logged-in user can upload a .eml file. Show a clean file upload UI (accept .eml only) and a “Submit” button. When submitted, send the file to the backend at /api/analyze-email and redirect to /result.\n3. /result: Displays the result of the phishing analysis (consume from backend, display as “Safe”, “Suspicious”, or “Phishing” with a short summary).\n\n✅ The app should:\n• Use React Router for navigation\n• Protect the / and /result routes (require authentication)\n• Use vanilla CSS, clean and minimal\n• Include a simple Header component showing “Logged in as [email]” and a “Logout” button on authenticated routes\n\nAssume that auth state (e.g. user session) is provided via HTTP-only cookies or backend session.",
