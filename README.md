# üì± Phishing Mail Detector - Monorepo Documentation

## Project Overview

This monorepo hosts a full-stack application comprising a React single-page application (SPA) for the frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend built using an MVC folder structure.

The app tackles a critical challenge in today‚Äôs digital landscape: phishing detection. With phishing attacks growing increasingly sophisticated‚Äîoften leveraging AI techniques to craft deceptive messages‚Äîit has become harder to distinguish genuine communication from malicious attempts. Our solution integrates robust user authentication (via Stytch magic links), secure file uploads (accepting only `.eml` files), and advanced phishing analysis powered by GPT-4o to assess the likelihood of an email being a phishing attempt. By combining secure backend processes with a clean, minimalistic frontend, this application offers a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to help mitigate phishing risks.

## Initial Prompt and Cursor Response

**Initial Prompt to Cursor:**

> **Backend:**  
> Build a Node.js (Express) backend using an MVC folder structure in a monorepo (with an existing React frontend). Implement user authentication via Stytch (using email magic links) by creating endpoints under `/api` (including `/api/authenticate` and `/api/auth/status`). Additionally, set up endpoints to handle `.eml` file uploads (using Multer) and process these files with GPT to analyze their phishing probability, returning a JSON with both a probability score and an explanatory description. Include validations (e.g., non-empty email content) and error handling (e.g., for invalid OpenAI API responses).
>
> **Frontend:**  
> Build a React SPA using vanilla CSS. The app must include protected routes using React Router. Create a login page (`/login`) that triggers the backend magic link flow, a Home page (`/`) where an authenticated user can upload a `.eml` file, and a mechanism (via a custom hook) to manage authentication state. Ensure the UI provides clear feedback (e.g., disabling the login button with a countdown) and a header that displays user information (e.g., ‚ÄúLogged in as [email]‚Äù) along with navigation buttons for actions like logout and setting an OpenAI API key.

**Cursor's Response:**

Cursor generated a solution covering both backend and frontend. The backend now provides robust endpoints for authentication, file upload, and phishing analysis with proper validations and error handling. The frontend was built as a clean SPA using React Router and vanilla CSS, including a login flow with magic links, file upload interfaces, and components for displaying phishing analysis results. Authentication state is managed via HTTP-only cookies, and a custom hook centralizes all auth logic.

**Was it what you expected?**

Yes, Cursor provided a strong foundation for a full-stack solution that meets our requirements while keeping the code modular, maintainable, and secure.

## Followup Prompts Regarding Features, and Cursor Responses

Below are the **10 most important feature-related prompts** implemented:

1. **MongoDB User Model:**  
   _Prompt:_ Create a model using MongoDB with fields for email, encrypted API key, freeTrial (boolean), and usageFreeTrial (counter).  
   _Response:_ The User model was implemented correctly and integrates with MongoDB.

2. **Mongoose Configuration:**  
   _Prompt:_ Create a configuration file to establish the MongoDB connection, reading the DB URL from the environment variables.  
   _Response:_ MongoDB connection was successfully configured using `DB_URL` in the `.env` file.

3. **Multer for .eml Uploads:**  
   _Prompt:_ Add Multer to receive `.eml` files on the `/validate` endpoint.  
   _Response:_ Multer was set up for file uploads at `/validate` with proper file storage and validation.

4. **Phishing Analysis with GPT:**  
   _Prompt:_ Create an Express function that receives a `.eml` file, sends it to GPT for phishing analysis, and returns a JSON with the phishing probability and explanation. Include a system prompt and API formatting settings.  
   _Response:_ The endpoint was implemented to analyze emails and return a JSON response with detailed assessment.

5. **API Key Management:**  
   _Prompt:_ Create a method to update the freeTrial status to false and store an encrypted API key from the request body, using a custom encryption utility.  
   _Response:_ API key encryption and freeTrial update functionality were added successfully.

6. **Email Content Validation:**  
   _Prompt:_ Add validation to ensure that the email content is not empty.  
   _Response:_ Empty email submissions are now properly rejected with a clear error message.

7. **Authentication Status Endpoint:**  
   _Prompt:_ Create the `/api/auth/status` endpoint to return an object with `{ authenticated: bool, email: string | undefined }`, and send a 401 for unauthenticated requests.  
   _Response:_ The endpoint now verifies authentication and returns the appropriate response or 401 error.

8. **OpenAI API Error Handling:**  
   _Prompt:_ Add a validation that sends a 400 error with an appropriate message when the OpenAI API response indicates an invalid API key.  
   _Response:_ Enhanced error handling returns a 400 status with a clear error message when the API key is wrong.

9. **Login Flow with Magic Links (Frontend):**  
   _Prompt:_ Implement the login page to trigger the magic link flow (POST to `/api/auth/login`), disable the login button for 15 seconds with a countdown, and update the UI accordingly.  
   _Response:_ The login functionality was implemented with a countdown timer and proper error handling.

10. **Authentication Custom Hook (Frontend):**  
    _Prompt:_ Move the authentication logic (fetching status, updating state, handling login/logout) into a custom `useAuth` hook.  
    _Response:_ The `useAuth` hook now encapsulates all authentication logic, streamlining state management and reusability.

## Followup Prompts Regarding User Interface, and Cursor Responses

Here are the **5 UI prompts** that were implemented:

1. **Global CSS Consolidation:**  
   _Prompt:_ Review all CSS files and move global styles into `index.css` for consistency.  
   _Response:_ Global styles were consolidated into `index.css`, ensuring a unified theme.

2. **Consistent Error Handling:**  
   _Prompt:_ Update the login component to mirror the error handling implemented in the UploadForm component.  
   _Response:_ Error handling was standardized across components, improving user feedback.

3. **Favicon Update:**  
   _Prompt:_ Change the favicon to use the custom `fishingMailAI.ico` file.  
   _Response:_ The favicon was updated successfully, replacing the default icon.

4. **Conditional API Key Button:**  
   _Prompt:_ Add a header button that navigates to `/set-api-key` when the user is logged in.  
   _Response:_ A conditional button now appears for authenticated users, improving navigation to the API key setup page.

5. **Home Navigation Button:**  
   _Prompt:_ Add an additional button in the header to navigate back to Home.  
   _Response:_ A Home button was added, enhancing user navigation throughout the app.

## Summary

**Final App Description:**

The final monorepo project delivers a robust full-stack solution designed to combat sophisticated phishing attempts. The backend, built with Node.js (Express) and organized using an MVC pattern, handles secure user authentication via Stytch, file uploads of `.eml` files, and advanced phishing analysis using GPT-4o. The frontend, a React SPA styled with vanilla CSS, offers protected routes, a clean login flow with magic links, and intuitive interfaces for uploading files and viewing analysis results.

**What I liked about Cursor:**

- It significantly accelerated both backend and frontend development by generating key functionalities and integrating complex processes.
- The generated code adheres to best practices and modular patterns (such as MVC and custom hooks), ensuring ease of maintenance.
- Cursor provided robust solutions for encryption, file handling, API integrations, and error handling, all critical for a secure and user-friendly application.

**Challenges / Issues:**

- Integrating various external APIs (Stytch, OpenAI, GPT) required fine-tuning and occasional manual adjustments.
- Maintaining consistent UI feedback and error handling across both frontend and backend demanded careful coordination.
- Ensuring seamless authentication and session management, especially when dealing with HTTP-only cookies, was complex but ultimately successful.

Overall, this project not only addresses the modern challenge of phishing‚Äîexacerbated by the sophistication of AI-driven attacks‚Äîbut also demonstrates how a full-stack application can be built quickly and reliably with the help of Cursor. This monorepo provides a strong foundation for secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital communication.
