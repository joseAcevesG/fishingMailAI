# ðŸ“± Phishing Mail Detector - Monorepo Documentation

## Project Overview

This monorepo hosts a full-stack application comprising a React single-page application (SPA) for the frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend built using an MVC folder structure.

The app tackles a critical challenge in todayâ€™s digital landscape: phishing detection. With phishing attacks growing increasingly sophisticatedâ€”often leveraging AI techniques to craft deceptive messagesâ€”it has become harder to distinguish genuine communication from malicious attempts. Our solution integrates robust user authentication (via Stytch magic links), secure file uploads (accepting only `.eml` files), and advanced phishing analysis powered by GPT-4o to assess the likelihood of an email being a phishing attempt. By combining secure backend processes with a clean, minimalistic frontend, this application offers a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to help mitigate phishing risks.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (package manager)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Stytch account for authentication
- OpenAI API key to use the GPT-4o model

### Why pnpm?

pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient, and secure package manager that provides a more efficient way to manage dependencies in a monorepo. It uses a single global store for all dependencies, which reduces the amount of disk space used and speeds up the installation process. pnpm also provides features like deduplication and zero-installs, which can improve the performance of your development workflow.

Also, this project uses pnpm workspace, which allows you to manage dependencies across multiple packages in a monorepo. for more information, check the [pnpm workspace documentation](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/joseAcevesG/phishingMailAI.git
   cd phishingMailAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create `.env` files in `/apps/backend` :

   ```
   PORT= (number of the port to use, this is optional, by default 3000)
   FREE_TRIAL_LIMIT= (number of free trials a user can have, this is optional, by default 3)
   STYTCH_PROJECT_ID= (string of the project id on Stytch)
   STYTCH_SECRET= (string of the secret key on Stytch)
   SECRET_KEY= (string of the secret key to encrypt data)
   SALT= (string of the salt to encrypt data)
   TOKEN_KEY= (string of the token key for JWT)
   DB_URL= (string of the MongoDB database url)
   OPENAI_API_KEY= (string of the OpenAI API key)
   ```

### Running the Application

- Start both applications:

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```

- Start backend:

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev:backend
  ```

- Start frontend:

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev:frontend
  ```

### Linter, formatter, and type checker

This project uses biome for linting and formatting.

- To **fix** fixable errors and **show details** of not fixable errors you can use:

  - Check (format and lint):

    ```bash
    pnpm run check
    ```

  - Format:

    ```bash
    pnpm run format
    ```

  - Lint:

    ```bash
    pnpm run lint
    ```

- To **show details** of errors you can use:

  - Check (format and lint):

    ```bash
    pnpm run check:detailed
    ```

  - Lint:

    ```bash
    pnpm run lint:detailed
    ```

  - Format:

    ```bash
    pnpm run format:detailed
    ```

- To run the biome on the front end or the back end add `:backend` or `:frontend` to the command:

  ```bash
  pnpm run check:detailed:backend
  pnpm run check:detailed:frontend
  ```

### Development Notes

- The backend runs on Express and uses MongoDB for data storage
- Frontend is built with React + Vite
- Both applications support hot-reloading for development
- Use `.eml` files for testing email analysis
